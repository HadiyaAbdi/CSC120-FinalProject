# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 **At first i thought about creating like an x and o type of game(which i did once in highschool for my class), but figured it will be too hard. i still was intrested in some type of a game that involves riddles so i ended up with my current idea pretty quick.**
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 **I wanted the game to be fun and mysterious—something a little spooky at first but light-hearted in the end, like Scooby-Doo. I focused on creating multiple classes to help organize the work and keep things modular as I built out different parts of the game.**
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
**I realized I could build something complex without a predefined structure from the instructor. I also surprised myself by remembering and applying most of the topics I learned earlier in the semester till now.**
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 **I added some methods early on that I thought I’d use, but ended up not needing. If I could go back, I’d be more intentional with my code structure to avoid unused or unnecessary parts.**
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
**I’d add a time-tracking feature so the player could input the start time and see how long they took to finish the game—just to make it more interactive.**
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
**I had trouble with the second part of the basement riddle—it wasn't properly checking if the player's clues matched the correct answers. Professor Mosca helped me during office hours and gave advice that helped me fix that logic.**
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 **Start with the main class before jumping into helper classes. I spent a lot of time figuring out how everything should connect because I didn’t have that structure early on.**
